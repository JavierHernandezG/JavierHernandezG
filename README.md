# Data Engineering Porfolio
Ahoi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Javier Hernandez, a passionate Data Engineer with over three years of experience developing data solutions for multiple business needs.

This is my Data Engineering Portfolio. In this ever-growing repository, I intend to give you and any onlookers a sneak-peak into the various tools useful in the collection, management and transformation of data.
